# Find My Device (fmd)

[![Build Status: Travis](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/FindMyDevice.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-services/FindMyDevice)

This server is still under development.

**Note:** The most stable version of this server is the *master* branch. "dev"
is marked as default to prevent accidental pushes to the master branch.

[Server API Reference Documentation](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/WheresMyFox#Server_API_Reference.2FDocumentation)

## Prerequisites:

You will need:

- A [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) database
- [golang](http://golang.org/) 1.3 or greater
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 0.10.x or greater and [npm](http://npmjs.org/)

## How to install:

1. Run `./install.bash` (will generate "./FindMyDevice")
  - For Production level installs, you will need to also run:
    `grunt build` in the ./static/ library. This will create a
    ./static/dist/ directory containing prebuilt items.
2. Copy [config-example.ini](config-sample.ini) to config.ini
3. Modify config.ini to reflect your system and preferences.

## Running:

`GOPATH` needs to be set to the root install directory. e.g.

```sh
./runserver.bash
```


## Managing your database

The FindMyDevice binary exposes 3 arguments to manage your schema
changes.

--ddlcreate "change description"
--ddlupgrade
--ddldowngrade "SHA revision"
--ddllog

All DDL changes are kept in subdirectories under `sql/patches` with a SHA1 hash and the change description in the directory name.

Each patch directory contains :
    - upgrade.sql
    - downgrade.sql.orig (optional)
    - prev.txt
    - description.txt

Any other files are ignored.

The upgrade.sql script is used for processing version upgrades of the
DDL.

A downgrade.sql.orig file is added to the patch directory, if you do
not rename it to downgrade.sql, no downgrade is defined downgrades
will halt at this version.

prev.txt keeps track of the previous version that this patch is a
child of.  This prevents merging of multiple branches where
simultaneous branches may cause multiple head database versions.  In
the case of multiple heads, an upgrade will abort.

description.txt includes the comment which is passed to --ddlcreate
